<h2 style="text-align:center;">To Annie Claiborne, 20 October 1851</h2>

<p style="text-align:right;">Smithland Ky
<br>20th. Oct 1851</p>

<p>Dear Annie,</p>

<p>I reached here at 10 Oclock today having had a tolerably good time in the mud I feel very tired I assure you, for so much unaccustomed exercise. Last night I had the worst time of the whole way. I stopped at Russ’ ferry 12 miles from here after dusk; I could get nothing to eat, save a slice of bacon I boiled myself and a piece of <u>hoe cake</u> & coffee made by the recruits, no sleep because I had to lie in a single feather bed of about 3 pounds and the <u>cords</u> of course were uncomfortable but I am so glad to get here without delay or loss that I over look these little inconveniences
<p>I hope to get off in two or three hours for Cairo, and thence I look for a speedy arrival at Jefferson Barracks—none of my men have deserted so far. I keep too sharp a look out on them.
<p>I do hope & pray that you are now entirely well; this is all that troubles are I can not but feel distressed at being absent from you when you are sick. Do take care of yourself & pay attention to your diet. I expect to find you entirely well on my return and depend upon it I shall not stay away a single unnecessary day. I think of you constantly, you seem dearer than ever to me, and you already know how well I love you. I would write you a longer letter but I have to look constantly after my men, & they bother me a great deal.
<p>I managed to get me seven or eight hounds on the road. I saw Lucy’s mother at Hopkinsville; they are all well. The weather was good, all the way except today, it is cold & cloudy, threatening rain.
<p>My face is dreadfully sun burnt & I feel ugly enough. I tell you.
<p>Love to Mary and Harriet and all the family. To Ma & all her family. send them word. Take excellent care of yourself my dear wife

<p style="text-align:right;">I ever yours only
<br>Th. Claiborne.</p>
