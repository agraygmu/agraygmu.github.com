<h2 style="text-align:center;">From John Claiborne, 14 August 1850</h2>

<p style="text-align:right;">New Orleans Aug 14th. 1850</p>

<p>Bvt Capt. Claiborne

<p>My Dear Thomas,</p>

<p>I received your letter of May announcing the result of the trial of the Cayuse Indians. I am glad to hear that you are to be so well paid for what you have done for them. I had feared that obstacles might have been placed in your way which you could not overcome. I alluded to the matter fifteen days since.
<p>I shall, unless prevented by unforeseen accident, leave here for Nashville tomorrow afternoon. While there, I shall if possible inform myself about your affairs with Annie so as to write by the packet of September from New York. In the meanwhile you must manage to keep patient until you hear all I can learn about it. You ask to hear something of V.B. I have not spoken a word with her except to salute her in the street for a year past. She is now I think in New York. When I last saw her she was looking well. The break between her foolish old mother and myself is to serious ever to be healed. She is an old “Beast” and I cannot be hyprocritical enough to <u>pretend</u> to respect her. V. and some others blamed me for my course in the matter, as too harsh. I have felt that I was right and have remained firm in my course. I am not sorry that things took the turn they did, V. wished me to continue her devoted admirer, but tho’ she did not pretend to conceal her partiality for me, she was not just enough to me to be willing to encounter a ridiculous old woman’s temporary vexation, by marrying me. Under such circumstances, I have to congratulate myself that occurrences transpired which enabled me to break off from her so completely. I mispent a great deal of time upon her, which I now think might have been more profitably employed.
<p>I have ordered the Pacific Crescent to be sent to you regularly. You will thus see what is going on in the world. It is to be published twice a month on the day of the departure of the Pacific mails. I should send some additions to your wardrobe if I could feel certain that they would ever come to your hands. I think of going to New York for a few days from N[<i>ashville</i>] and while there I will see what can be done for you.
<p>I am in a great hurry and have many affairs to arrange before leaving. I heard from James and Sally within a few days; at Nashville all were well having happily escaped the cholera which raged for a month very fatally.
<p>I shall be here again by the 1st. October & have a prospect of a good winter’s business before me.
<p>I refer you to the newspapers for general news. Trusting that you have found your new station agreeable in every respect, I remain



<p style="text-align:right;">Yours Affectionately
	<br>John Claiborne</p>
