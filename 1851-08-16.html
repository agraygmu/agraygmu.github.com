<h2 style="text-align:center;">From John [Palmer], 16 August 1851</h2>

<p style="text-align:right;">Jefferson Barracks
<br>Aug. 16 1851</p>

<p>Capt. Th: Claiborne
<br>Regt. Mtd. Riflemen
<br>Nashville, Tenn:</p>

<p>Dear Claiborne,</p>

<p>Your last of 7th. Aug. I received a day or two since & I have spoken to Maj about that money. He has promised to send it <u>very soon</u>. And you are to ship off so soon eh? I wish I could be there to see you [swing] off. You have done well; you will now be a respectable man. I wish I <u>could</u> do something for myself in this way. They keep me so busy here that I hardly have time to do any Courting. The Col. has insisted on my performing the duties of Post as well as [Regimental] Adjutant besides attending to the recruiting parties It is too much and I shall soon begin to kick.
<p>Every one here looks about as they did three years ago save those who are married look as though they had been washed up. Nannie Walker is a most devoted wife—at least I judge so from the amount of Cooing that I see between her and the Pills.
<p>There is quite a swarm of girls here now but bah! I am not the individual I was one. I would as soon think of running a foot race with the The[<i>illegible</i>] at [<i>illegible</i>] as to get up a flirtation now. Smith and Morris do the most of the gallantry now. Morris is ordered to Carlish—Porter also.
<p>The Court Martial is not through with Buft yet. I believe he will be convicted. They had adjourned for a day to wait for Russell.
<p>We have but a few men here now but there are more than 200 at Carlisle. They will be ordered here in October I suppose.
<p>Write soon and tell me all about <u>Annie</u>. I will drink her health and if she insist on it I will get tight on the 1[5]th.
<p>Col. & Maj. wish to be remembered to you and <u>Annie</u>:

<p style="text-align:right;">Very truly yours
<br>Jn [Palmer]</p>

<p>In your return for July, you should have had for <u>total</u> of <u>parties and recruits</u> 3 & not 4. see *
<p>P.S. Recruiting Regulations inform you where you are to receive funds from. Have you not an army Regulations? If you have [not] you had better ask [Gen.] R. Jones for one. What is the $6 bounty you speak of? I have never heard of any such bounty. Take care you don’t let some of these 2d. Auditor’s and things down on you.
<p>Please be punctual in forwarding your monthly return of Recruiting Party & recruits. I have received your return for <u>July</u>. The Dept Gen. informs the Col. that all the officers have been furnished with the Regulations—if you have [less men] you had better inform the Dept. of the fact

<p style="text-align:right">[Yours]
<br>Jn P.</p>
