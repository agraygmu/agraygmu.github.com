<h2 style="text-align:center;">To Roger Jones, 15 August 1851</h2>

<p style="text-align:right;">Nashville Tennessee
<br>Augt 15th. 1851</p>

<p>Genl. R Jones<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
<br>Adjutant General
<br>U.S.A.</p>

<p>Sir</p>

<p>Your communication of 8th inst; was this day received.
<p>I have the honor to call your attention to the fact, that I have received from your Offices a Copy of Refutations for the Recruiting service, accompanied only with blank forms for Recruiting papers &c in these regulations there is a paragraph relating to twelve dollars bounty to be paid to Recruits “one half at the time of Enlistment” &c. “General Orders No. 20 1850,” have never been sent to me.
<p>I did, in strict conformity with the Regulations above referred to, pay to some <u>twenty five</u> Recruits six dollars bounty In Equity and justice I claim that such account, therefore, as I shall send for the month of Aug. & as will as last July may be allowed—in that I may be directed to stop the said six dollars against said recruits on first Pay role to reimburse the Govt. In the meantime I have /nearly/ disbursed the $200 funds for Recruiting Service. and ask for more. I cannot recollect from the recruits the Bounty I have already made, and you perceive how unwittingly I have paid out these funds. I /hope/ you /will/ therefore allow my request that said $150. be charged against the recruits first Pay Role & thus relieve me from the hard condition of refunding myself.
<p> In what way shall I act in the care of a previous enlistment & service with an honorable discharge, said discharge not in the possess[ion] of the party, a Land warrant having been obtained therein, and parted with? Is not the party entitled to the three months extra pay?

<p style="text-align:right;">I am sir
<br>Very Respectfully
<br>Yr Obt Svt.
<br>Th’ Claiborne
<br>Bvt. Capt USA
