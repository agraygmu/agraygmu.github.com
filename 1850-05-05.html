<h2 style="text-align:center">From Duncan R. Claiborne, 5 May 1850</h2>
<p style="text-align:right">Nashville May 5th. 1850</p>

<p>My Dear Tom</p>

<p>We were quite delighted on the reception of your letters, to hear that you had arrived at your destination in the “Far West” without any “damage or delay.” As Sally has given me her letter to direct and send to you I am fulfilling both my duty & pleasure in writing to you. I have no doubt but that she has told you all the “<u>news</u>” much better than I could have done, so it will not be necessary for me to repeat it.</p>
<p>I was out at Cousin Jessee’s about 1 month ago.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> He was <u>then</u> very severely afflicted with Neuralgia in his back; so much so that for several days he had to remain in the house altogether. He is now much better, he was in town 10 days ago.
<p>He always enquires after you and expresses the <u>warmest</u> feelings of friendship for you. I think that he <u>old fellow</u> likes you very much. Harriet although she is no longer Harriet Maxwell is the same old Harriet she has not “sobered down” a particle.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref1">2</a></sup> I can form no idea yet whether she <u>will be</u> happy as Mrs. Overton or not. You were only in jest when you you [sic] used to accuse me of loving her, but to tell the truth <u>I loved her in earnest</u> but tis past. I am no longer the <u>boy</u> the <u>silly thoughtless lad that I was</u>. I have <u>thought</u> more in the 10 months that I have been in the Post Office than <u>I ever did in all my life before</u>.
<p>I have been slightly promoted too in my official capacity. From all I can hear I have given very general satisfaction—but even Washington had enemies. Mary M. has forgiven you but you know <u>she</u> could not hate any one more than a day.
<p>I think that she is one of the greatest women I have ever seen. They all enquire when we heard from you every time they see me. Ann—you know.
<p>I am very sorry indeed to say that unless something occurs with Jim C. & Jim MCall, that they both will be forever ruined as it is impossible for either of them to keep from drinking indeed Jim MCall is a drunkard. He yesterday told me he was going to reform—whether it is perminent or not I cant say.
<p>John has been appointed Notary Public by Gov Walker. He thinks that he will make a great deal of money at the business—and save it.
<p>I have from time to time sent you bundles of newspapers in which I thought you might find something to interest you if you ever recd. them which is I reckon very doubtful.
<p>There was a convention (or rather 2 of them) called and met in this city today. The one which was supported by the Democratic portion of the community was in favor of appointing delegates to the convention to be held in this city in June next. The Whigs were in favor of <u>considering</u> the <u>prospicts</u> of appointing delegates &c. One meeting decided <u>not</u> to appoint delegates the other <u>to appoint</u> them. Mr. Ramage & sister Mary are still boarding at Henry’s Mr. Ramage has not engaged in any business yet. How do you manage to <u>kill time</u> away off from civilization as you are. The California fever has operated pretty strongly in Tennessee as there have been a <very> great many companies passed through here on their way to the “land of golden <u>promises</u>.” I have not been at all affected by it yet. Jim has had a slight touch but it ended in— “I haven’t got the money or d—d if I didn’t go.” Henry flew about a few days, and the conclusion of his California speculation was that he took stock in a company which recently left. I can <u>make</u> money <u>here</u> but it is very <u>hard</u> to <u>keep it</u>. Bet I am now studying economy and I trust to save <u>something</u> every year. I shall hold on to my situation in the Post Office until I get another <u>better</u> one. I am doing very well and I believe that my conduct satisfies Dr. L. who has acted very kindly with me. Every one is well I believe of your acquaintances. Sad as Sally has written you a long letter and I have no doubt told you all the news I shall bring my more tedious although shorter letter to a close.
<p>May God bless you and enable you to make an ample fortune to satisfy all your wants, that you may retain your good health and happiness, and that it may not be long ere we meet is my earnest desire.
<p>It would offord me the greatest happiness to receive a long letter from you when ever you may feel disposed to write and rely on me it shall be answered by the best and longest one I can manufacture.
<p style="text-align:right">Good bye I am your affectionate bro.
