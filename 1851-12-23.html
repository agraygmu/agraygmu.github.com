<h2 style="text-align:center;">To Winslow F. Sanderson, 23 December 1851</h2>

<p style="text-align:right;">Nashville Tennessee. Decr. 23d. 1851</p>

<p>Maj W. F. Sanderson: Comdg. Rifles<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

<p>Sir.</p>

<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the recpt. of your letter communication this day.
<p>For several days past, intense cold has prevailed here; the rain froze over in many places & fell, thereby closing navigation to Smithland; Telegraphic reports state the present impassable condition of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. For two days past a very great sleet has fallen hereabouts, which makes it impossible for me to proceed, via Louisville, & thro’ Indiana & Illinois the stage route: <u>Today</u> it has <u>commenced thawing</u> & <u>weather greatly moderated</u>. I have judged it better to attempt the river, which I am assured, will in all probability be passable in a few days.
<p>I shall make such disposition to start at the <u>earliest possible moment</u>. I am sorry these orders have come at such a frozen up time as I am most anxious to join the Regt.
<p>I have been quite unwell for a week past Serg’t Strong has also been on sick report until yesterday for near a week.
<p>I shall not delay in obedience to these orders, but I fear considerable detention en route /& will soon write you./

<p style="text-align:right;">Very Respectfully
<br>yr obt svt
<br>Th’ Claiborne, Bv Capt.</p>

<p>[<i>Endorsed</i>] acknowledge receipt of orders—of 15th. inst. and state cause of detention
