<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>As a military man during the mid-nineteenth century, Thomas Claiborne served in the Mexican-American War, on the western frontier in the territories of Oregon and New Mexico, and on the Confederate side of the Civil War. His was a life that witnessed many of the century’s significant moments, for he took part in both the expansion of the United States and efforts to bring about its disunion. Along the way he also associated with many of the nineteenth-century’s important military leaders.</p>

<p>Presented here are the edited papers of Thomas Claiborne from 1849 to 1851, during which time he served at western forts along the Overland Trail and in Oregon Territory. The papers include letters to family in Nashville and New Orleans, as well as military correspondence. The subjects discussed in the letters range from family updates to national politics, and from financial reimbursements to salmon fishing. Altogether, the Thomas Claiborne papers from 1849-51 provide a firsthand account of not only one man’s military life, but a broader understanding of one man’s place within a larger portrait of American history. His military career during this time was part of important federal efforts to encourage and protect westward migration and ultimately the expansion of the nation across the West. Correspondence from his family reminds readers of other important events occurring at the same time in other parts of the country and even other corners of the world. Lastly, more personal notes about family, friends, and lovers, add a touching depth of character to Captain Thomas Claiborne.</p>
